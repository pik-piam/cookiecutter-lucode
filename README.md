# cookiecutter-lucode

A template for an R package using [lucode2](https://github.com/pik-piam/lucode2) to automate manual tasks.
Mostly useful if you want to create a package in the [PIK PIAM](https://github.com/pik-piam) universe.

## Instructions

To create a new project:

**Install cookiecutter**

[Install cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) if you don't have it already.

**Generate the basic files**

In the terminal, run `cookiecutter gh:pik-piam/cookiecutter-lucode` and answer all the questions.

**Create a git repository**

If you use the terminal, switch into the new directory and run `git init .; git add .; git commit -m 'initial commit'` to create a git repo.

**Create and populate github repository**

This is easiest using the [`gh` command line tool](https://cli.github.com/). If you have it installed and
configured, you can create the repository under the `pik-piam` name space, push the files you have so far,
and create an own fork using the terminal:
```
gh repo create --public --push --source . pik-piam/<your package name>
gh repo fork
```

This may fail because you don't have the necessary permissions on github. In that case, please contact RSE.

Alternatively, you can do this all with the github web interface and the terminal:
1. Create a new repository via the web interface at [github:pik-piam](https://github.com/organizations/pik-piam/repositories/new).
2. Add the github repository as your remote in git using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/pik-piam/<your_project>`.
3. Push your repo using `git push upstream main`.
4. Create a fork of the repository at the repository's web page.
5. Add this fork to your repo using `git remote add origin https://github.com/<your username>/<your project>`

**Run buildLibrary for the first time**

Run `Rscript -e 'lucode2::buildLibrary()'` for the first time to get the latest configs for everything. Commit and push the result.

**Contact RSE to begin distributing the new package**

To be able to easily install the package in R, the new package needs to be added to the pik-piam package repository, which can be done only by RSE, so please contact us.
